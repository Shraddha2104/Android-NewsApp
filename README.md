## Synopsis

This project was completed as a part of my coursework for the course CSCI 571: Web Technologies at the University of Southern California, Spring 2020 under Prof. Marco Papa.

## Why?

**Problem**: How in the world do you keep track of all hot:fire: news happening around? Way too many! It's like a Russian novel! Help! :astonished:

**Solution**: We stream the news you need and can add them to read-it-later list to read according to your convenience. We'll source, sort, summarize and quantify different news categories

- For people with goldfish memory, who can only keep 7Â±2 people in their heads at all times! :grimacing:
- For people who're just too lazy for lookups! Sometimes you just want happenings at a glance! :star:
## Installation Guide
The app can be installed and tested in 5 steps:
1. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) on your machine.
2. Create an [Android Virtual Device (AVD)](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) in your Android Studio.
3. Clone the Android-NewsApp repo to your local machine.
4. Open the cloned local project in Android Studio.
5. Run the app.
